Finished setting up this Zap! Now my process is exactly the way I want it.

- Delight
- Pride
- Savvy

### Tips

- Your user deserves a high-five—give them a verbal one to encourage them along the way.

# Help Documentation

### What the User is Thinking

I don't understand why my MailChimp test isn't working. I really needed to get this workflow set up for my campaign today.

### What the User is Feeling

- Confusion
- Frustration
- Determination

### Tips

- Clarity is key. Help this user get the answer they need as quickly as possible so they can continue setting up their Zap.
- Use words that they'd be familiar with in context—like "Campaign" for MailChimp.
- Don't get cute. Avoid jargon.

### What Zapier says

MailChimp requires email addresses to be in the standard `your@email.com` format. Double-check the email field in your Zap for invalid characters, like quotation marks and commas.

- Optimism

### Tips
