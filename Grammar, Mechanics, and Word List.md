# Grammar, Mechanics, and Word List

Good grammar won't fix crummy writing, but it will help your ideas shine. At Zapier, we write to teach, inform, and empower our users. Grammar helps us accomplish those goals in the most efficient and clear way possible.

The house rules covered here apply to all public-facing we make. These aren't rules for the sake of rules—the guidelines in this section give you the tools to write consistent content that helps our users.

## Basics



## Words to avoid

When writing other content, whether or not it's about Zapier itself, avoid these:

- Young, old, elderly, tween, millennial, or any other word describing someone's age
- Crazy, insane, nuts, psycho, or similar words to describe a person
- Any sort of profanity, even in a direct quote (let's keep it clean)
- Gendered job titles
    + Mail carrier, not mailman or postwoman
    + Firefighter, not fireman

Reference the [Conscious Style Guide](http://consciousstyleguide.com/) or ask your teammates if you're unsure about a specific situation.

## Mechanics and Style

### Headlines

For headline levels one and two (H1 and H2) we follow general title case guidelines: 

- Capitalize the first and last word of a headline
- Capitalize 
    - adjectives (orange, helpful)
    - adverbs (quickly, easily)
    - nouns (dog, truck)
    - pronouns (she, our, themselves)
    - verbs (run, connect—don't forget helping verbs like is, have, and are)
    - subordinate conjunctions (once, as, if, when they connect unequal parts of a sentence)
    - prepositions with five letters or more (through, without, above)
- Lowercase
    + articles (a, this, the, that)
    + coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or)
    + prepositions with fewer than five letters (from, over, with) but not through or without)
    + the "to" in an infinitive (For example, "How to Play Guitar")
- Capitalize the first word after a colon, no matter what
- Use numerals like 25, 6, and 4 for all numbers; never write them out
- Use single quotes for any quoted piece of text

When in doubt, use [this capitalization tool](https://headlinecapitalization.com/) to get a properly formatted version of your title.

For headline levels three and below (H3, H4, H5) we follow sentence case rules:

- Capitalize the first word of the headline
- Capitalize the first word word after a colon, no matter what
- Capitalize titles and proper nouns

### Quoting people and publications

When you're quoting a person or publication in a piece of content, make sure that quote is accurately attributed. Use present tense (says, not said): 

> "I love using Zapier to automate my work," Jimmy says.

Try to introduce the quoted person before you quote them. This:

> Selena, a manager at Galactic Donuts, uses Zapier to track orders. "It makes my life so much easier," she says.

Is preferred to: 

> "Zapier makes my life so much easier," Selena, a manager at Galactic Donuts, says.

Keep the focus on the person who said the quote by placing their name directly after it, before "says". Use "he", "she", or "they" when you're quoting the same person in quick succession and it's clear that the quote belongs to the same speaker. If the quotes are close enough, you can leave out the second "says" entirely.

> "I think 'Rumours' is my favorite Fleetwood Mac album," Matt says. The record—released in 1977—took home Album of the Year honors at the Grammy Awards, and it's a staple in any music fan's library. "You can't listen to 'Second Hand News' without bobbing your head."

Accurate quotes are important, but we also want to make our subjects look good. Feel free to edit out the "ums" and "uhs" from a direct quote. It's ok to tweak the grammar in a quote, but use caution not to change the quote's meaning. When in doubt, ask your subject for clarification or approval.

### Abbreviations



### Capitalization

In text, capitalize the first word of every sentence, unless it's camel case (like eCommerce or eBay). For headlines, use title case on H1s and H2s, and sentence case beyond that.

Always capitalize proper nouns, like someone's name or a business name. 

Never capitalize website names or email addresses. For example: 

> If you want to learn more about automation, visit zapier.com or send an email to contact@zapier.com.

### Dates and times



### Jargon and industry phrases



### Numbers



### Names and Titles



### Punctuation

#### Apostrophes



#### Commas

Use the Oxford comma (also called the serial comma). In lists of three or more items, always include a comma before the last item.

> You can use Zapier with MailChimp, Trello, and Slack.

#### Dashes



#### Exclamation points



#### Hyphens



#### Semicolons

Try to avoid semicolons. They tend to be difficult to use well, and bring a more formal tone to your writing. 

Write around them using dashes, commas, and coordinating conjunctions instead. 

> He promised to send me the details today—and a summary showed up in my inbox at 5 p.m.

Not

> He promised to send me the details today; they showed up in my inbox at 5 p.m.

Do use semicolons, though, to clarify a complex list of comma-separated items. For example:

> For Elise, Rob, and Melanie, Trello fit perfectly; it gave them task-tracking, color-coded labels, and the ability to assign Cards to the right person.  

Use semicolons sparingly. Try to edit around them. When they're necessary, use semicolons as a more powerful version of a comma, which separates two related thoughts. 



#### Quotation marks

## Writing About Partners and Other Companies

When writing about partners, default to their style. Write Tweet, not tweet. Write Trello card, not Card or to-do. Follow regular capitalization rules at the beginning of sentences.

If you don't know, ask. When in doubt, skew towards understanding. If an app lets you create "things", capitalize Things to let the reader know that this is a specific feature of the app, and to avoid confusion.

## Writing About Zapier

### Zapier-specific words and terms

Like many apps, Zapier has its own lexicon for explaining the product. We try to keep things as simple as possible, but here are some terms that hold special meaning in our app.

#### Zap

A Zap is a workflow made up of apps, one Trigger, and one or more Actions. Each piece of a Zap is called a step. Zaps connect your apps

> "To save time, set up a Zap that automatically tweets out blog posts as they're published."

*Step Notes*: Zap should always be capitalized. For inexperienced users, it's helpful to call Zaps "workflows".

#### Task

Zaps automate Tasks. A Task is counted every time Zapier does something on your behalf. If you set up a Zap that automatically sends emails, each time we send an email, it counts as a Task.

> "Last week, this Zap automated 126 Tasks for you."

*Style Notes*: We capitalize Task because it's part of our pricing structure, and we want to avoid confusion around the "tasks" that might exist in to-do or project management apps that someone connects to Zapier.

Task should be capitalized only when referring to an item that Zapier automates. For example, in this sentence, "task" should not be capitalized: 

> "Erin wanted to take that task off her plate, so she used Zapier."

Make sure you avoid saying things like "Zaps complete Actions." While this is technically true, it creates some confusion around our pricing terms.

#### Trigger, Action, and Search Action

Zaps are made up of building blocks called Triggers and Actions. There's also a special type of Action called a Search Action.

The **Trigger** the first step of any Zap. It's the signal that tells us when automatically complete the **Actions** in a workflow.  Here's the process in sentence form: 

*When this Trigger happens, do this Action, (then this Action, etc.)*

Actions generally create or update something in an app, and Triggers tell them when to do it. 

**Search Actions** are different. They look up existing data in an app, and return it so you can use it in a following step.

*Style Notes:* Capitalize Trigger, Action and Search Action when they're used as nouns. Leave them lowercase, though, if they're used as verbs.

> "This Zap triggers whenever someone fills out my typeform. Then, I use a MailChimp Action to add their email address to my mailing list."

We also use Trigger and Action alongside the word "step" when we're talking to someone about their Zap.

> 

#### Premium apps

A handful of integrations on our platform are marked as [Premium apps](https://zapier.com/zapbook/#sort=premium&filter=all). You need a paid account to use these apps. 

*Style Notes:* When talking about Premium apps, only capitalize the word "Premium", as it refers to something that requires Zapier Premium. If you're displaying a Premium App in our app, do your best to mark it as "premium" so users aren't surprised later.

#### Multi-Step Zaps

A Multi-Step Zap is any Zap with three or more steps. 

#### Autoreplay

#### Task History

#### Zapier Premium and plan names

#### Zap templates

### Words to avoid

When talking about Zapier, avoid these:

- Sync (Zapier doesn't truly "sync" data between two apps)
- Export (this implies that Zapier can tap into old data)
