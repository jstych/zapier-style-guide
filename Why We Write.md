# Our Writing Goals and Principles

When we create content at Zapier, we aim to:

- **Clarify.** Make the hard stuff easy. Real experts understand every aspect of a topic, but they can boil it down to the basics. Don't make people work to understand your point.
- **Help.** Who's reading this content, where and when are they reading it, and what they need to know? Tell them exactly what to do, or what happens next. You're the teacher and this is your classroom.
- **Empower.** Guide people through Zapier with words that inform and inspire. Our users are smart; never talk down to them.
- **Add Value.** Is what you're writing useful? How could you make it more useful? Make sure people get more out than they put in. 

To that end, all content you create at Zapier—from microcopy to book-length guides—should be:

- **Clear.** Explain ideas with plain language, not perplexing prose. Work to iron out any wrinkle that might confuse someone.
- **Encouraging.** Reassure users, spur them forward, and celebrate when they succeed. Make people feel like they deserve a booming high-five.
- **Authentic.** Be the expert, then write like one. Earn your reader's trust by writing with intelligence and authority.
- **Human.** Imagine sitting across the table from a friend, and explaining this topic to them. What words do you use? What's your tone like? Craft your content with that warm, cheerful tenor.
- **Worthwhile.** All killer, no filler. Have a reason for every page, paragraph, sentence, and word you publish. If it doesn't add value, cut it.
- **Appropriate.** Adjust your tone to fit the situation. Put yourself in the reader's shoes. Send the right message at the right time.
