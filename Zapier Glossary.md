# Zapier Glossary

Let's get granular about the words we use, and the ones we don't.

## Zapier-Specific Concepts

Like many SaaS apps, Zapier has its own lexicon for explaining the product. We try to keep things as simple as possible, but here are some terms that hold specific meaning in our app.

### Zap

A Zap is a workflow made up of apps, one Trigger, and one or more Actions. Each piece of a Zap is called a step. Zaps connect your apps

> "To save time, set up a Zap that automatically tweets out blog posts as they're published."

*Step Notes*: Zap should always be capitalized. For inexperienced users, it's helpful to call Zaps "workflows".

### Task

Zaps automate Tasks. A Task is counted every time Zapier does something on your behalf. If you set up a Zap that automatically sends emails, each time we send an email, it counts as a Task.

> "Last week, this Zap automated 126 Tasks for you."

*Style Notes*: Task should be capitalized only when referring to an item that Zapier automated. For example, in this sentence, "task" should not be capitalized: 

> "Erin wanted to take that task off her plate, so she used Zapier."

Make sure you avoid saying things like "Zaps complete Actions." While this is technically true, it creates some confusion around our pricing terms.

### Trigger, Action, and Search Action

### Multi-Step Zaps

### Autoreplay

### Task History

## When Writing about Partners

Default to their style. Write Tweet, not tweet. Write Trello card, not Card or to-do. Follow regular capitalization rules at the beginning of sentences.

When in doubt, skew towards understanding. If an app lets you create "things", capitalize Things to let the reader know that this is a specific feature of the app, and to avoid confusion.

## Words to Avoid

When talking about Zapier, avoid these:

- Sync (Zapier doesn't truly "sync" data between two apps)
- Export (this implies that Zapier can tap into old data)

When writing other content, whether or not it's about Zapier itself, avoid these:

- Young, old, elderly, tween, or any other word describing someone's age
- Crazy, insane, nuts, psycho, or similar words to describe a person
- Any sort of profanity, even in a direct quote (let's keep it clean)

Reference the [Conscious Style Guide](http://consciousstyleguide.com/) or ask your teammates if you're unsure about a specific situation.
