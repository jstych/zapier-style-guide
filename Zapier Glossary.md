# Zapier Glossary

Let's get granular about the words we use, and the ones we don't.

## Zapier-Specific Concepts

Like many apps, Zapier has its own lexicon for explaining the product. We try to keep things as simple as possible, but here are some terms that hold specific meaning in our app.

### Zap

A Zap is a workflow made up of apps, one Trigger, and one or more Actions. Each piece of a Zap is called a step. Zaps connect your apps

> "To save time, set up a Zap that automatically tweets out blog posts as they're published."

*Step Notes*: Zap should always be capitalized. For inexperienced users, it's helpful to call Zaps "workflows".

### Task

Zaps automate Tasks. A Task is counted every time Zapier does something on your behalf. If you set up a Zap that automatically sends emails, each time we send an email, it counts as a Task.

> "Last week, this Zap automated 126 Tasks for you."

*Style Notes*: Task should be capitalized only when referring to an item that Zapier automated. For example, in this sentence, "task" should not be capitalized: 

> "Erin wanted to take that task off her plate, so she used Zapier."

Make sure you avoid saying things like "Zaps complete Actions." While this is technically true, it creates some confusion around our pricing terms.

### Trigger, Action, and Search Action

Zaps are made up of building blocks called Triggers and Actions. There's also a special type of Action called a Search Action.

The **Trigger** is the first step of any Zap. It's the signal that tells us when automatically complete the **Actions** in a workflow.  Here's the process in sentence form: 

*When this Trigger happens, do this Action, (then this Action, etc.)*

Actions generally create or update something in an app, and Triggers tell them when to do it. 

**Search Actions** are different. They look up existing data in an app, and return it so you can use it in a following step.

*Style Notes:* Capitalize Trigger, Action and Search Action when they're used as nouns. Leave them lowercase, though, if they're used as verbs.

> "This Zap triggers whenever someone fills out my typeform. Then, I use a MailChimp Action to add their email address to my mailing list."

### Premium Apps

A handful of integrations on our platform are marked as [Premium Apps](https://zapier.com/zapbook/#sort=premium&filter=all). You need a paid account to use these apps because they're more complicated to support. 

*Style Notes:* When talking about Premium Apps, capitalize both words. If you're displaying a Premium App in our app, do your best to mark it as "premium" so users aren't surprised later.

### Multi-Step Zaps

A Multi-Step Zap is any Zap with three or more steps. 

### Autoreplay

### Task History

## When Writing about Partners

Default to their style. Write Tweet, not tweet. Write Trello card, not Card or to-do. Follow regular capitalization rules at the beginning of sentences.

When in doubt, skew towards understanding. If an app lets you create "things", capitalize Things to let the reader know that this is a specific feature of the app, and to avoid confusion.
