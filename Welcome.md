## If you work at Zapier

We're a remote company, and clear written communication is crucial to our success. As such, everyone at Zapier writes. But talking to coworkers is different than talking to customers. 

This style guide targets the latter kind of conversation. It covers the foundations of Zapier's voice and tone, plus goals for content. We'll also dig into some nitty-gritty grammar notes.
