# Welcome to the Zapier Voice, Tone, and Style Guide

This style guide is a reference for anyone who writes words at [Zapier](https://zapier.com/). 

## If you work at Zapier

Everyone at Zapier writes. We're a remote company, and clear written communication is crucial to our success. But talking to customers is different than talking to coworkers.

This style guide zooms in on those customer conversations. It covers the foundations of Zapier's voice and tone, plus the goals for our content. We'll also dig into some nitty-gritty grammar notes.

<!--something about how you can make suggestions once we have the site up and running-->

## If you work somewhere else

&#128075; Thanks for stopping by! We hope this is a helpful look into how we work at Zapier. We drew major inspiration from [MailChimp's Content Style Guide](http://styleguide.mailchimp.com/) while putting this together, so be sure to check in with them, too.
