Hundreds of apps integrate with Zapier, and sometimes we get the chance to write directly to their audiences. This is an opportunity to make Zapier proud, and to make our partners look good.

# Guidelines

When writing content for someone else's site, play by their rules. Stay consistent with Zapier's style for concepts related to our product, but try to harmonize with the partner's voice. 

**Match their style.**

Make sure capitalizing the right words and using the right terms. Mechanics matter when you're talking to another app's power users.

**Emulate their voice.**

Read some of the content this partner's published before, and mimic their style. Strike a balance between making frequent readers comfortable, and writing in your voice.

**Use relevant examples.**

Leverage the reader's existing knowledge. Explain Zapier's value with examples that match the context.

**Avoid awkward associations.**

We work with a lot of partners, and some of them compete with each other. Never reference a potential competitor on a partner's site. 

**Assume zero Zapier knowledge.**

Remember your audience might never have heard of Zapier before. Don't be afraid to cover the basics.
