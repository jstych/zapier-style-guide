## Mechanics

### Words to Avoid

When talking about Zapier, avoid these:

- Sync (Zapier doesn't truly "sync" data between two apps)
- Export (this implies that Zapier can tap into old data)

When writing other content, whether or not it's about Zapier itself, avoid these:

- Young, old, elderly, tween, or any other word describing someone's age
- Crazy, insane, nuts, psycho, or similar words to describe a person
- Any sort of profanity, even in a direct quote (let's keep it clean)

Reference the [Conscious Style Guide](http://consciousstyleguide.com/) or ask your teammates if you're unsure about a specific situation.

### Headlines

For headline levels 1 and 2 (H1 and H2) we follow general title case guidelines: 

- Capitalize the first and last word of a headline
- Capitalize words four letters and longer
- Capitalize adjectives (orange, helpful), adverbs (quickly, easily), nouns (dog, truck), pronouns (she, our, themselves), verbs (run, connect—don't forget helping verbs like is, have, and are), and subordinate conjunctions (once, as, if, when they connect unequal parts of a sentence)
- Capitalize the first word after a colon, no matter what
- Lowercase articles (a, this, the, that), coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or), and prepositions with fewer than 5 letters (from, over, with—but not through, and without)
- Lowercase the "to" in an infinitive (For example, "How to Play Guitar")
- Use numerals for all numbers; never write them out
- Use single quotes for any quoted piece of text

When in doubt, use [this capitalization tool](https://headlinecapitalization.com/) to get a properly formatted version of your title.

For headline levels 3 and below (H3, H4, H5) we follow sentence case rules:

- Capitalize the first word of the headline
- Capitalize the first word word after a colon, no matter what
- Capitalize titles and proper nouns

### Quoting People and Publications

<!--might need to split this into longform and shortform sections-->

When you're quoting a person or publication in a piece of content, make sure that quote is accurately attributed. Use present tense (says, not said): 

> "I love using Zapier to automate my work," Jimmy says.

Try to introduce the quoted person before you quote them. This:

> Selena, a manager at Galactic Donuts, uses Zapier to track orders. "It makes my life so much easier," she says.

Is preferred to: 

> "Zapier makes my life so much easier," Selena, a manager at Galactic Donuts, says.

Keep the focus on the person who said the quote by placing their name directly after it, before "says". Use "he", "she", or "they" 

<!--do we want to use first or last names?-->

Accurate quotes are important, but we also want to make our subjects look good. Feel free to edit out the "ums" and "uhs" from a direct quote. It's ok to tweak the grammar in a quote, but use caution not to change the quote's meaning. When in doubt, ask your subject for clarification or approval.

### Punctuation

#### Hyphens

#### Dashes

#### Semicolons

Try to avoid semicolons. They tend to be difficult to use well, and bring a more formal tone to your writing. 

Write around them using dashes, commas, and coordinating conjunctions instead. 

> He promised to send me the details today—and a summary showed up in my inbox at 5 p.m.

Not

> He promised to send me the details today; they showed up in my inbox at 5 p.m.

Do use semicolons, though, to clarify a complex list of comma-separated items. For example:

> For Elise, Rob, and Melanie, Trello fit perfectly; it gave them task-tracking, color-coded labels, and the ability to assign Cards to the right person.  

Use semicolons sparingly. Try to edit around them. But when they're necessary, use semicolons as a more powerful version of a comma, which separates two related thoughts.
