# Writing Email Newsletters

Email is one of the most effective ways to communicate with Zapier users when they're not in the app.  

<!--this needs some more meat on its bones-->

## Guidelines

**Send Relevant Content.** Use segmentation and good timing to give readers content they want, when they want it. 

**Be a Good Guest.** This reader invited you into their inbox. Respect their interests, and remember that they can ask you to leave at any time.  

**Know Why You're Sending.** Send with purpose. Identify why your reader would be interested in this message, and what you want them to do next.

**Get to the Point.** Don't dawdle. Find the fastest way to get your message across and guide your reader to the next point in their journey.
