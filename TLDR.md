## Writing Tips

1. **Write Like You Talk.** Close your eyes and imagine and imagine saying this to someone, face-to-face. Be conversational. Ask questions. Use contractions. Read your work out-loud before you publish it.
2. **Put Yourself in the Reader's Shoes.** What's important to the reader at this exact moment? Where'd they come from, and where do they want to go?
3. **Use Examples.** Make them specific to the reader's experience. If you know they're a Facebook user, talk to them about Facebook.
4. **Be Brief.** Get to the point. Work hard to trim unneeded words from your sentences. Never use a confusing word when a simple one will do.
