## Voice and Tone

Whenever you write, it's important to think about who's reading. This section covers the difference between voice and tone, why they're important to our work at Zapier, and how the mechanics apply to the content you create.

### Why Are Voice and Tone Important?

### What's the Difference Between Voice and Tone?

Voice encompasses the personality of your writing. Our voice is something that's uniquely Zapier. It brings life to our content, . Voice doesn't change much.

Tone, on the other hand, changes constantly. It adapts to the situationâ€”and might even involve suppressing your voice. 

Think of it this way: If you're praising your dog doing a trick, or scolding him for getting into the trash, you're going to use two different tones. 

## Voice at Zapier

At Zapier, we want computers to do more, so people can focus on the human side of work. With that in mind, always write with a human voice. Speak as if you're sitting across from your reader in a cafe, explaining something or telling a story. 

Our voice is warm, conversational, clear, and encouraging. We don't meander into tangents, or talk down to our readers. Our goal is to educate and empower people without confusing them.
