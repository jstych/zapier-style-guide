## When Writing about Partners

Default to their style. Write Tweet, not tweet. Write Trello card, not Card or to-do. Follow regular capitalization rules at the beginning of sentences.

When in doubt, skew towards understanding. If an app lets you create "things", capitalize Things to let the reader know that this is a specific feature of the app, and to avoid confusion.

## Words to Avoid

When talking about Zapier, avoid these:

- Sync (Zapier doesn't truly "sync" data between two apps)
- Export (this implies that Zapier can tap into old data)

When writing other content, whether or not it's about Zapier itself, avoid these:

- Young, old, elderly, tween, or any other word describing someone's age
- Crazy, insane, nuts, psycho, or similar words to describe a person
- Any sort of profanity, even in a direct quote (let's keep it clean)

Reference the [Conscious Style Guide](http://consciousstyleguide.com/) or ask your teammates if you're unsure about a specific situation.
