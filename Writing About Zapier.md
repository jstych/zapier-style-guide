## How we describe Zapier to new users

When you're introducing Zapier to a new audience, focus on the pillars of our product:

- **Integrations** Zapier is the bridge between the world's most popular web apps. We offer more options than anyone, and we're adding new ones all the time.
- **Automation** Zapier lets you set up automated workflows called "Zaps" that pass info between your web apps. Let them handle repetitive tasks while you focus on more important work.
- **Code-Free** Zapier helps anyone tap into APIs without writing a lick of code. Build workflows in minutes that would normally take hours of engineering time. Developers love it, too, because it's on us to maintain the integrations.

Try to capture two or three of these benefits in your first sentence:

- Zapier moves info between your web apps automatically, so you can focus on your most important work.
- Zapier helps you automate anything in the apps you use most, so you can get back to the human side of your business.
- Zapier adds powerful automation to more than 750 web apps. Their tools make it simple for anyone to build code-free workflows that save hours per week.

When possible, zone in on a specific app. Examples that are relevant to your reader are the best way to create a lightbulb-moment.

- Zapier helps you move info between MailChimp and your other web apps automatically.
- Zapier lets anyone automate tasks with Slack and connect it to more than 750 other apps.
- With Zapier, you can build workflows that automatically send new Typeform results to your email list, CRM, or wherever else as soon as they come in.

The more specific we can be, the better.

## What doesn't resonate with new users

- Technical language It's easy for Zapier to feel "too technical" fast, especially for someone who's uncomfortable with automation. We try to limit the number of technical and Zapier-specific terms we use for new users, like:
Data In our testing, people were scared off by the word "Data". We try to use "Info" instead, or shoot for specifics (e.g. email addresses, to-dos, etc.) when possible.
- Zap Introducing "Zap" too early confuses people. We try to use "Workflow" in its place, and drop something like "...workflows called 'Zaps'" into the messaging.
- Trigger and Action These phrases are foreign to new users and make them feel out of the loop. We try to explain the concepts instead, like "Zapier watches for new info in one app, then routes it to another app of your choice."
- Apps and use cases that aren't their own If we need to explain both an app involved in a workflow and Zapier itself, we're fighting two battles on the education front. It's usually best to keep examples general—like email or SMS. The downside: This makes it tougher to illustrate the power of Zapier.
